# pod-reader

> now this is pod ~~racing~~ reading

This isn't meant to be "good" or "production" code, it is a unfactored set of
code that should be able to read files from a solid pod that require
authentication. It probably doesn't handle everything as I've only tested it
against https://inrupt.net, and I know from reading specs I've missed stuff
out. But, then, the specs are confusing because there are many of them and they
all differ...
